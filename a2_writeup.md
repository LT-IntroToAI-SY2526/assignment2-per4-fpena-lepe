# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
The most difficult part of the match function was #2. #2 was hard because you had to really understand what exactly match was supposed to do in all the cases of a % being in the pattern array. It took me a while to understand all the conditions in #2 but after a while I was able to do it. 


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
You could extract the words inside _ or % and try and find a pattern in the input. Use the exracted words to find things inside the movie database. You would use the specific info that the user wants (the % or _), use that info and look it up inside the movie database.
